A visualization of earthquakes occuring between 1900 and 2007, using different visual channels to encode location, depth, and magnitude. Data was provided by  the US Geological Survey and the vis was created as an assignment for CPSC 313 at Gonzaga University (http://www.cs.gonzaga.edu/faculty/schroederd/S18/cpsc313/hw/hw4.html). Code is written in Processing and background map was found here: http://pnavarrc.github.io/workshop-d3-maps/pages/geographic-projections/.
